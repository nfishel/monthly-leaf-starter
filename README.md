#### Potted Collection

Plants that come in pots! All ready to go. All our pots are hand-picked from local crafters.

#### Ivy Collection

Climbing plants! That climb the walls! Incredible. What a world we live in. A different type each month

#### Cactus Collection

Spiky, spiky, plant friends. Sometimes they flower which is pretty great (and worth the prickles).
